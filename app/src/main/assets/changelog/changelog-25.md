  - `DiffUtil` is faster, animates changes and keeps focus on previously focused event on top
- Merge `EventAdapter` and `EventViewHolder`
- Merge `MeasurementAdapter` and `MeasurementViewHolder`
  - Therefore the location observer was decoupled from `MainActivity`
- Update Android Architecture Components to 1.0.0-beta2
- Fix `Fragment` `menu` visibility
